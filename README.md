#Food Truck Finder

This application implements the [Uber coding challenge](https://github.com/uber/coding-challenge-tools/blob/master/coding_challenge.md).

Users in the San Francisco area can find food trucks near them. Food Truck data is rendered on a visual map, and the user can move their location on the map to receive updated results.
